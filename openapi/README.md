# SDKWork IM SDK OpenAPI Sources

This directory stores the OpenAPI source documents for the `sdkwork-im-sdk` workspace.

## Files

- `craw-chat-app.openapi.yaml`
  Authority OpenAPI 3.x contract for the app-facing IM SDK surface.
- `craw-chat-app.sdkgen.yaml`
  Generator-compatible derived input consumed by `sdkwork-sdk-generator`.
- `craw-chat-app.flutter.sdkgen.yaml`
  Flutter-compatible derived input that expands primitive component refs before Dart generation.

## Rules

- The authority contract is the source of truth and is refreshed from the live service export before generation.
- The derived contract exists for generator compatibility and normalization only.
- The derived contracts also carry `x-sdkwork-sdk-surface` plus per-operation `x-sdkwork-*` ownership hints so generator layers can consume stable service, surface-group, and transport metadata directly from the checked-in sdkgen inputs.
- Generated SDK packages must never edit either file in place.
- The live service schema endpoint is `/openapi/craw-chat-app.openapi.yaml`.
- The service export resolves schema content from `CRAW_CHAT_APP_OPENAPI_SCHEMA_PATH` first, then the workspace authority file, then the embedded fallback bundled into `local-minimal-node`.
- Root regeneration wrappers refresh the checked-in authority snapshot from the live service export, then regenerate the derived contracts before SDK generation.
- The checked-in authority file remains the last successful live schema snapshot for review and diffability inside the repo.
